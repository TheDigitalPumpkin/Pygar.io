# Pygar.io
Agar.io recreated in Python, using Pygame


# Requirements
In order to play, you'll need:
- Python, minimum version 3.7.1
- Pygame, minimum version 1.9.6

# TODO
This entire thing is still incomplete. Right now there's just "food cells" and "poison cells" being generated randomly, and an AI that follow you around. Still gotta add a different, more randomized behavior to the AI, and some customization options for the player's cell.
